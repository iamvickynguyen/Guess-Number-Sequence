# Guess-Number-Sequence
A game to train the brain

## Instruction
Enter 4 numbers from 1-4. The game will tell you how many correct numbers, and correct positions there are.

#### Example:  
&nbsp; Answer: <strong>4 3 2 4 </strong> <br>
&nbsp; You enter:<br>
- 1 2 2 2 -> 3 correct numbers, 1 correct numbers and correct positions <br>
because number 2 is in the answer, and your sequence has three number 2's. Only number 2 at the third position is correct

- 3 1 1 3 -> 2 correct numbers, 0 correct numbers and correct positions <br>
because number 3 is in the answer, and your sequence has two number 3's. None of your number has correct position.

- 4 4 4 2 -> 4 correct numbers, 1 correct numbers and correct positions <br>
because both number 4 and 2 are in the answer, and your sequence has three number 4's, and one number 2 (3+1=4). Only number 4 at the first position is correct.
